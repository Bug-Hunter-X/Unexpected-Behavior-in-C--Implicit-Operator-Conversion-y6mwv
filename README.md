# C# Implicit Operator Conversion Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with implicit operator conversions in C#.  When converting a string to a custom class using an implicit operator, there's a risk of unexpected behavior if the string cannot be parsed correctly. The default behavior may not be immediately apparent and could lead to subtle bugs.

## Bug Description
The `MyClass` example uses implicit operators for conversion to and from strings.  If the string conversion fails (e.g., "abc" cannot be parsed as an integer), the code silently defaults to a zero value.  This could be problematic, masking the error and resulting in incorrect calculations or program states.

## Solution
The improved version adds explicit error handling in the conversion operator, either by throwing an exception or returning a nullable value to indicate failure.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the project.
4. Observe the output.  Compare the behavior of the original bug with the solution.
